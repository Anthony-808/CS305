Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that creates specialized investment plans for its clients. The company tasked me with adding modern security features such as file validation to its web application to ensure secure communications. I began by identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities, implementing the new features in a way that kept the code simple, modular, and secure. Secure coding is critical for protecting client trust and preventing security incidents. To support this, I added three key features: a checksum for file integrity, secure communication, and robust error handling. I then ensured the code remained functional and secure by testing it and comparing the dependency check results from before and after implementation. For future assessments, I would first verify that these foundational security measures are in place, and then run a dependency check to identify vulnerabilities introduced by third-party code. This tool played a central role in the project, though working with it presented some challenges.
Initially, the dependency check flagged nearly 200 vulnerabilities. I managed this by identifying unused or unnecessary libraries and suppressing warnings related to them, which significantly reduced the number of reported vulnerabilities and allowed me to focus on the actual security issues. Alongside this filtering approach, I found the Oracle’s Secure Coding Guidelines and the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram particularly helpful. Independently, while working on the project, I also developed better habits such as breaking code into functions and using try-catch blocks. I would use my work on this project—detailed in the Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report—to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in software security. This report shows that I can implement secure communications and file validation without introducing new vulnerabilities.
